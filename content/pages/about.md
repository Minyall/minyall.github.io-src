title: About me

Once a mild-mannered media theorist, one day James got bored, taught 
 himself to code and transformed into a computational sociologist. It only 
 hurt a little bit.

 I have a background in studying digital cultures, media theory and the 
 intersection of society and technology. These days I spend much of my time 
 building software tools to extract new and interesting datasets, and 
 custom analysis tools to explore them. This work encourages a lot of collaboration
 meaning I end up working on a wide variety of projects with other fantastic scholars
 around the world.
 
 If I'm not doing either of the above I like to spend my time with Sim/strategy
 games, watching kids films with my kids, and reading cosmic horror because
 ultimately reality is a vast indifferent force to which humans mean nothing.
 
 I also like rabbits.
